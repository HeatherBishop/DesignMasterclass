  itemInfo: 'The Lyceum theatre was opened in 1891 and was designed by Walter Emden.
    Walter Emden also designed The Royal Court Theatre in London which is still open
    to this day. The Lyceum theatre started off its life as a drama theatre and later
    began to screen films and eventually became a full-time cinema after World War
    1 until the 1930s. It eventually closed and was converted into a department store
    before being demolished in the late 1980s. '
