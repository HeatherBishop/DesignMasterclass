  itemInfo: 'This wooden post and steel bell once stood at the start/finish line of
    the Ipswich racecourse which was located on Nacton Heath. The very last race meeting
    for the racecourse was held in 1911. The Racecourse Pub one stood on the racecourse
    finishing line but has since been demolished and replaced by a Tesco Express and
    extra housing. '
