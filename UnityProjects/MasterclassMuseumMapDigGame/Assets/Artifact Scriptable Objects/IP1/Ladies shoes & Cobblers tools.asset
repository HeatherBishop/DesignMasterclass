  itemInfo: "Thomas Alderton first started his business in 1853 and business was booming.
    So much so that he opened a larger outlet in 1857 at 44 Butter Market. Business
    continued to be successful and his store was the first in Ipswich to be lit with
    electricity. Alderton\u2019s continued trading until a fire in 1992 destroyed
    the building. It was later rebuilt and reopened as Jones\u2019s Shoe Shop. Did
    you visit Alderton\u2019s in the 140 years the business was open?"
