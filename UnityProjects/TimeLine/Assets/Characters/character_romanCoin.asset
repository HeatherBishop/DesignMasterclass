  itemInfo: Some of the Roman coins found in Chantry when brand new council housing
    was built there 70 years ago. We know that for thousands of years, Ipswich has
    been a place where people have come into contact with ideas and inventions from
    across the world. What money, souvenirs and ideas have you brought back from your
    holidays?
