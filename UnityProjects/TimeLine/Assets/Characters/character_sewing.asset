  itemInfo: Local lady Jean Patterson was born in 1924 and was 70 years old when she
    made this to celebrate her 50th Wedding anniversary. It features the words "Jean
    and Ted, 1944-1994". This is one of several items we have in the collection made
    by Mrs Patterson. What have you made to celebrate or remember a special occasion?
