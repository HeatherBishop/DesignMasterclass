  itemInfo: "These programmes were produced to give theatre-goers information about
    storylines, cast and crew, but also feature local business adverts in return for
    sponsorship, which tell us lots about the town\u2019s entrepreneurial past. \nWhich
    performances do you remember watching in Ipswich\u2019s theatres, cinemas and
