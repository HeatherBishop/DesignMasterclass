  itemInfo: "The theatres and cinemas of Ipswich have always played a huge role in
    the lives of local people, both as performance makers and as audiences. Many a
    theatrical career has been launched in Ipswich, including those of Mary Ann Keeley
    and David Garrick. These programmes were produced to give theatre-goers information
    about storylines, cast and crew, but also feature local business adverts in return
    for sponsorship, which tell us lots about the town\u2019s entrepreneurial past.
    Which performances do you remember watching in Ipswich\u2019s theatres, cinemas
    and stadiums? What memorabilia do you keep as a souvenir?"
