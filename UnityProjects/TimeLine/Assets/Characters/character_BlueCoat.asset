  itemInfo: "150 years ago, this carved wooden figure of a \u2018Bluecoat\u2019 boy
    decorated the Christ\u2019s Hospital charity school for poor children. Ipswich
    was one of the first towns to commit to providing shelter, food and education
    for children in poverty. How does our community support its children and families
    in need nowadays?"
