  itemInfo: A machine used to spin lots of thin lengths of cord into one thicker,
    stronger rope, across quite big distances. The oldest rope walking area in the
    town was in what it still known as Ropewalk, but there was also ropewalks on Wherstead
    Road, London Road and Cliff Quay. Which machines make your life easier? Which
    are still to be invented?
